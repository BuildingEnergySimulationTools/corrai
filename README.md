## Measured Data Exploration and Enrichment

This Python library is designed to handle measured data from test benches or Building Energy Management Systems (BEMS). It offers a range of features to help identify and correct measurement errors, fill gaps in data, and perform analysis using artificial intelligence (AI) tools. 

## Features

The library includes the following features:

- **Error identification :** basic error detection such as unrealistic values or unrealistic variations.

- **Data gap filling:**  basic correction methods for filling gaps in the data, allowing users to generate a more complete dataset.

- **Data plotting:** generate plots of measured data, visualize gaps and filling methods effects.

- **AI tools for fault detection and energy analysis:** The library includes artificial intelligence tools for fault detection and energy consumption analysis. These tools can help identify anomalies in the data and generate insights into energy usage patterns.
